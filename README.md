# Programming for Data Analytics Assignments

## Overview
This repository contains the weekly assignments associated with the Programming for Data Analytics course. The assignments focus on key topics: CSV files and JSON, visualising data in Matplotlib, manipulating data and NumPy.

## Assignment 2 Task 1
This task was to demonsrate the basics of `python` and to practise adding and pushing data into GitHub.

## Assignment 2: Weather.ipynb
The main objective of this task was to practise visualising data. The `pandas` module was first imported and the CSV file of the weather readings was uploaded through Pandas and the dataframe was created in VS code. A plot of temperature in Celsius over reportStartDateTime was created which shows the temperature rise and then fall over time.

## Assignment 3: Pie.ipynb
Like with assignment 2, assignment 3 practises visualising data but includes cleaning and manipulating the data first and touches on the concept of `Regular Expressions (RegEx)`. The CSV file conatins the information of 1000 people including their emails. The emails are separated into groups by the three different domains and plotted on a pie chart by their percentage of occurance. `Pandas` and `matplotlib` libraries are imported for this task.

## Assignment 5: Risk.ipynb
This assignment explores concepts of `NumPy` such as random number generators and 1D and 2D arrays. These concepts are explored through simulating 1000 battle rounds from the board game Risk.
