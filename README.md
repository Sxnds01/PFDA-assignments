# Programming for Data Analytics Assignments

## Overview
This repository contains the weekly assignments associated with the Programming for Data Analytics course. The assignments focus on key topics: CSV files and JSON, visualising data in Matplotlib, manipulating data and NumPy.

## Assignment 2 Task 1
This task was to demonsrate the basics of `python` and to practise adding and pushing data into GitHub.

## Assignment 2: Weather.ipynb
The main objective of this task was to practise visualising data. The `pandas` module was first imported and the CSV file of the weather readings was uploaded through Pandas and the dataframe was created in VS code. A plot of temperature in Celsius over reportStartDateTime was created which shows the temperature rise and then fall over time.

## Assignment 3: Pie.ipynb
Like with assignment 2, assignment 3 practises visualising data but includes cleaning and manipulating the data first and touches on the concept of `Regular Expressions (RegEx)`. The CSV file conatins the information of 1000 people including their emails. The emails are separated into groups by the three different domains and plotted on a pie chart by their percentage of occurance. `Pandas` and `matplotlib` libraries are imported for this task.

## Assignment 5: Risk.ipynb
This assignment explores concepts of `NumPy` such as random number generators and 1D and 2D arrays. These concepts are explored through simulating 1000 battle rounds from the board game Risk.

## Assignment 6: Weather.ipynb (2) 
This assignment explores the `datetime` module and the `Timeseries` module which is often used to clean large datasets that may have dates in different formats or missing data. The dataset in this assignment had to go through rigorous cleaning using modules such as `numpy` and `datetime` in order to plot graphs from it.
